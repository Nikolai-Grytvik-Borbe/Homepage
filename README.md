This is my personal website where I share class notes, blog-posts, and some information about myself.

## Unique to this website
I've...
* added LaTeX to Astro.
* implemented my own search & sort algorithm (all be it a simple one).
* created a countdown, down to the second I start school (probably!).
* created a dynamic way of displaying posts. By creating a new Markdown file a post will:
    1. Be automatically sorted, and displayed acordingly on the different pages.
    2. Display a (new) badge if the post is less than 5 days old.
    3. Generate random art from Dalle.
    4. Add any repeting information like: *autor* & *date*.
* added automatically generated flashcards, unique to each post, that can be used to practice class work.
