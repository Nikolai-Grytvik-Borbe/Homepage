## Markdown (mdx)
I'm not actually using Markdown. Instead, i'm using MDX, which let's you write code in the Markdown document.
It let's me write function with LaTeX, like this:
<Math client:visible func={"\\frac{1}{2}"} />
<Math client:visible func={"a = b^2"} />

I still need to learn it, but quite a few people are saying they take notes faster like this, so I'll give it a shot.

You can still do all the "normal" stuff as well in Markdown. Like creating titles: "# Title Here", bullet points: "* or -", and numbered lists: "1. 2. 3.".
Best thing is, it's a lot faster. 

# Title Here

Bullet points:
* One
* Two
* Tree

Numbered lists: 
1. One
2. Two
3. Tree

## Markdown also lets you write code blocks

Using: \``` text ```, you will write code blocks.
```
Like this 
```

Or just outline text like this: `Text`

## You can also embend links

[Go to the markdown guide to learn more](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

## You can also do Flahscards
<Flashcard q={"What is the meaning of life?"} a={"42"}/>

<Flashcard q={"2+2"} a={"4"}/>
